            <p>I was much more attracted to sport bikes like the Honda <br>
              CBR 600 or the Suzuki GSXR 600. My intention was to buy <br>
              a sportbike but my brother in law talked me out of it. He's <br>
              a Harley guy and convinced me to start out on something heavier <br>
              and not super fast. He knows I love speed and was looking out <br>
              for me I guess.. </p><p>I didn't regret my decision <strong>AT ALL.</strong><br>
              The sound of a Harley is incredible. Very loud and throaty.<br>
              Believe it or not, the loud exhaust saved my life several times.</p>

              <h4>April 2015</hr>
                <p>I got my certification from the Motorcyle School in San
                  Antonio. They're now permanently closed unfortunately.

              <p>Plasti-Dip is a spray paint that you can peel off. It's kind of like a really thin rubber material
                and sprays on like a matte paint.</p>
                <p>I wanted to keep the gas tank the original color but only focus on the fenders.</p>

            <h1>Install Vance & Hines Short Shot Exhaust</h1>
              <h4>June 2015</h4>
              <p>I did a lot of research on what type of exhaust I wanted. I wanted to keep the black and sand camo combination and wanted a loud exhaust. I finally settled on the short shot exhaust.</p>

              <h4>June 2015</h4>
              <p>The better your motocycle can breathe, the more responsive it'll be. My factory air intake was great but not
                an open intake so I found a better alternative. This is a "naked" style air intake which means it's exposed. Sounds
                great whenever you turn it on, you can hear it sucking in air.</p>

              <h4>July 2015</h4>
              <p>The Fuelpak connects to the motorcycle's ECU which allows you to create fuel maps
              and tune your motorcycle. The coolest part about the Fuelpak is that it has bluetooth capability
             so you can see everything on your phone.</p>

            <h1>The Twisted Sisters Ride</h1>
              <h4>July 2015</h4>
              <p>The twisted sisters is one of the best roads in Texas to ride. Incrdible turns, views, and
                amazing restaurants to visit. It was a total of 100 miles, very tiring to do on a sportster but it was
                worth it. </p>
                <p>This route took us close to 6 hours to do, taking into account all of our stops</p>
                <br>

              <a href="http://www.ridetexas.com/the-twisted-sisters/" target="_blank">Check it out!</a>

            <h1>Riding in North Carolina</h1>
              <h4>September 2015<h4>
                <p>In late 2015, I moved to Raleigh, North Carolina for a new job. I had the opportunity to ride
                  all over the city of Raleigh, Durham and Cary. Much more biker friendly than San Antonio.</p>
